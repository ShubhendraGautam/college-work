Lebal Refinement:
Red -> Experimental
Black -> Generated Pattern
Green  -> Braggs position

Full Prof -> EDPCR -> New Data -> General -> Optimized -> Pattern -> Add -> 
Data File -> Pattern and Calculation ->  Peak shape -> Pseudo Voight -> Range (From file) -> Bakground -> 

Phases->Add->Cubic->Lebal->profile matching with constant scale factor->Calculated automatically->Contibution to pattern->Xray->Pseudo Voight->
Symmetry-> Pm -3 m -> Symmetry optimize automatic -> Size of refinement -> Profile Section -> Give values -> Fix all -> OK
