X-Ray generation
X-Ray Floresecence
Elastic/Inelastic scattering
K-alpha-> used in le bail refinement, K-beta
Difraction, Absorption, Spectroscopy
X-Ray photo electron scectroscopy
Photoelectron, binding energy, threshold frequency
Photoelectric effect, Valence band
Auger electron
Orbital angular momentum, spin angular momentum
Spin Orbit Coupling

Due to diif in the BE the SOCE they must differ SOCE in diff elemen.
Carbon Correction
Carbon peak->286.4

Spin Orbit Coupling energy

Crystallite size, grain size, particle size
Polycrystalline, single crystalline
in polycrystalline: Crystallite size < grain size < particle size
In single crystalline: all are same
FWHM-> Full width at half maxima, HWHM->Half Width at half maxima
Debye equation for XRD peak, Debye-Scherrer Equation
